            <h2>Feeding Habits</h2>
            <p>Newborn white sharks feed on fishes and other sharks. As they reach adulthood, their prey includes sea
                turtles, seals, sea lions, porpoises, dolphins, and small whales. Prey is usually hunted by ambush,
                where the shark will attempt to rush the animal by surprise and inflict a sudden and massive fatal bite.
                Often this initial rush is so strong that the intense impact may send the prey out of the water or will
                send the shark into the air if it misses the target. The sharks will retire and wait for the prey to
                quickly die, giving rise to the terms bite and spit or bite and wait for this method of attack. White
                sharks are also opportunistic scavengers and will feed on the carcasses of whales and basking sharks;
                however, they are not indiscriminate.</p>

            <h2>Attacks on humans</h2>
            <p class="highlight">In the areas where they are most common, white sharks are responsible for numerous
                unprovoked, and sometimes fatal, attacks on swimmers, divers, surfers, kayakers, and even small boats. A
                white shark tends to inflict a single bite on its human victim and then retreat. In many instances,
                however, the shark does not return for a second bite. If the victim suffers a moderate bite, he or she
                may have time to seek safety. In situations where a large bite occurs, however, serious tissue and organ
                damage may result in death. A review of white shark attacks off the western United States showed that
                about 7 percent of attacks were fatal, but data from other localities, such as South Africa, show
                fatality rates of more than 20 percent. Fatality rates as high as 60 percent have been recorded from
                attacks in the waters off Australia.
                Many researchers maintain that attacks on humans stem from the shark’s curiosity. In contrast, other
                authorities contend that these attacks may be the result of the shark mistaking humans for its natural
                prey, such as seals and sea lions. It is also possible that white sharks intend to attack humans where
                their normal prey may be scarce.</p>

            <h2>Social behaviour</h2>
            <p>Little is known about the social behaviour and natural history of the white shark. There appears to be no
                apparent social structure; however, there is evidence that some sharks may be territorial and assume
                dominance hierarchies around feeding areas. White sharks are largely solitary, but some pairs have been
                seen to travel together and associate for long periods of time. Some individuals may reside within
                feeding areas throughout the year, whereas other individuals may leave the feeding area and migrate
                widely. For example, some white sharks off California have been tracked to Hawaii, and some South
                African white sharks have been tracked to southern Australia and back.</p>
